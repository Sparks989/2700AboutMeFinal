			<p class="aboutMeText"> I have lived in Georgia for twenty-one years now. My family has a house on Lake Burton. I spent most of my summers there and have developed a deep bond with my family largely in part to our shared destination. While I am a fourth year at Georgia Tech, I spent my first three years here a Mechanical Engineering major. I then changed majors to Computational Media. I have participated in many clubs while at Georgia Tech, but the one I have spent the most time with is the Yellow Jacket Fencing Club(YJFC). I had never fenced before coming to Georgia Tech, but had a lot of fun learning over the time I spent at the club.</p>
